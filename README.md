# Hello there! I'm Muhammad Nubhan bin Mohd Takiyuddin ðŸ‘‹

## Software Engineer | Problem Solver | Lifelong Learner

I am a dedicated Software Engineer currently working at Kumpulan Aplikasi Sempurna Sdn. Bhd., where I am driving productivity through expert integration of multiple applications. Prior to this, I was an Intern Software Engineer at Ikhlas, where I translated Figma designs into responsive code and implemented features to improve the user experience.

I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and familiar with Python, Golang, and C#. I have experience with frameworks like React.js, Node.js, .Net6, Laravel, Bootstrap, and Tailwind. I am skilled in tools like Git and VS Code and have a working knowledge of databases and APIs including MySQL, REST API, and GraphQL.

I am passionate about solving complex problems, optimizing code, and learning new technologies. My curiosity and desire to learn drive me to explore, experiment, and push the boundaries of my knowledge.
